## Strange Attractors and Turtle Graphics

An [attractor][1] is a set of numerical values to which a mathematical system converges, and 
a *strange attractor* is one which in these values have a fractal structure. Though the mathematics 
of these constructs are quite scary, you don't need to be a genius to appreciate their beauty, or 
to write some Python code to plot them.

In this project, we're looking at two attactors - *Lorenz* and *Thomas*.

## The Lorenz Attractor

The [Lorenz equations][3] are given as:
